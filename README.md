## Pulse Newsletter Readership Analytics

As the editor of the MSU MPH student newsletter, I was interested in better understanding newsletter readership to inform efforts to improve reach to MPH students. 

To draw meaningful insight from the raw readership data downloaded from the newsletter's MailChimp dashboard, I leveraged Python data management and visualization libraries pandas and seaborn. The results suggested that the main newsletter readers were the students already on the advisory board, and the program faculty and staff.

These results were used to inform changes to the newsletter to improve reach to the general student body.
